# CLAUDE — runtime entry & agent contract (lgwks)

Canonical agent contract for this repo. `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file.
This file exists because the repo's truth is distributed; read this before
concluding anything from a partial search.

## What this repo is
`lgwks` — local-first, privacy-respecting developer research and refactoring
toolchain. Python CLI (`lgwks` dispatcher at root) + Rust frontier crawler
(`crawler/`) + stdlib-only byte framework (`axiom/`).

## Structural invariant — do not "clean up" the root
The ~100 `lgwks_*.py` files at root are **load-bearing**. The `lgwks` dispatcher
imports them by module name (`__import__("lgwks_<cmd>")` + `SourceFileLoader`,
see `lgwks` ~lines 1834–1901). Moving them into a package breaks the CLI and the
`cl-ideas` overlay symlinks. Root sprawl here is a contract, not a mess.

## Authority ladder (who wins on conflict)
1. **Data/ingestion layer** → `spec/second-harness/INGESTION-LAYER.md` +
   `INGESTION-PLAN.md` (v1.0, final). Supersedes anything older that disagrees,
   including `docs/SPEC-tier-e-machine-model-v1.md` (historical draft).
2. **Runtime lanes / nervous system** → `docs/machine-nervous-system.md`.
3. **Byte framework** → `axiom/` module docs + `docs/axiom-end-to-end-framework-2026-06-06.md`.
4. **Governance & refusal policy** → `governance/` (see `governance/README.md`).
5. **Doctrine (cross-fleet)** → `vision/prompts/_doctrine.md`.
Build-state truth lives in `spec/second-harness/BUILDLOG*.md`, not in spec prose.

## Startup read order
1. This file.
2. `governance/README.md` — governance map.
3. `spec/second-harness/HANDOFF.md` + `INGESTION-PLAN.md` — current work packets.
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system shape.
5. Assigned issue(s) — GitHub Issues are the work tracker.

## Search discipline (verify before assert)
Partial search is the dominant agent failure mode. Before claiming a file,
module, or spec does not exist: `git ls-files | grep -i <term>` and
`git log --all --oneline -- '*<term>*'`. Before trusting a doc's status claims
(e.g. "X is stale"), check the file's own header and `spec/second-harness/BUILDLOG.md`.
Cite the path you verified, not the path you remember.

## Repo constellation (cross-repo map)
- `~/logicalworks-` — this repo (lgwks toolchain).
- `~/logic-os-kernel` — Logic OS kernel (Rust, three pillars, ADR-004);
  governance in `laws/governance/`; entry doc `CLAUDE.md` there.
- `~/cl-ideas` — **private overlay of this repo**: its `lgwks_*.py` are symlinks
  into `../logicalworks-` (managed by `cl-ideas/scripts/link-logicalworks-core.sh`);
  only business/client material is local to it. Changes to engine code happen
  HERE, never in cl-ideas.
Entry doc in each repo is `CLAUDE.md` (`AGENTS.md` symlinks to it).
