# Handoff — lgwks subconscious build · 2026-06-12 (session 14, main @ 418e888)

> Session 10–11: opened **I8-hardening** (#89), landed L1+L2+L7/L3/L4/L5 — §1-INV cryptographically enforced; **#89 closed**.
> Session 12: shipped the **CIAM convergence epic #97** (build order B→A→C): #98 capability lifecycle + operator promote, #99 access-router mandatory gating (`ADMIN` sentinel + `TenantStore`), #100 CRDT live convergence (`reconverge`). **Epic CLOSED.**
> Session 13: shipped the three additive micro-debts left open from #97 — #104/#105/#106. Canonical next *surface* remains **D2 network/MCP transport** (SCOPE-DEFERRED.md).
> Session 14: shipped **daemon core Moves 1–8** (DAEMON-CORE-PLAN.md §5): Codex+Gemini ingress adapters (P4), WorktreeManager + CRDT audit (P2), content-addressed export tier (P5). 74 tests green. Git aligned (12 merged branches deleted, 2 worktrees pruned). Governance refreshed.
> The dated "Session N state" sections below are append-only history — the **latest** state is the **session-14** block at the bottom.

You are the next agent on the lgwks rebuild. Read this fully before acting. Written
AI-for-AI; receipts, not essays. Authority ladder: `/CLAUDE.md` → `governance/README.md`
→ `spec/second-harness/INGESTION-PLAN.md` (work packets) → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → the
assigned GitHub issue. Build-state truth = `BUILDLOG.md`, not spec prose.

## Hard constraints (do not violate)

1. **The model layer is OUT OF SCOPE.** Do not spec, map, or touch it. Treat all models
   (Eye/Tongue/Membrane, Ollama, Gemini, Qwen3-VL, CoreML) as opaque deps. The
   text=local-Qwen / media=cloud-Gemini split is INTENDED. If a step needs the model
   layer, STOP AND ASK.
2. **Verify before you assert.** Every claim about env/git/files/tests runs the command
   first. `cargo test` / `pytest` is the verifier. Use the repo venv: `.venv/bin/python`.
3. **No emojis. No sprawl.** Receipts. Don't mirror the Director's thinking-out-loud.
4. **On a real fork in the Director's intent, ASK (AskUserQuestion).** Don't ask what the
   code can answer; read the code.
5. **No silent failure, no gate weakening.** When a check fails, fix the thing under test,
   never loosen the gate. Surface degeneracy/non-convergence loudly.

## Current state (verified — main @ docs-update commit)

Ingestion packets I1–I6 + I12 are **done and merged**. The deterministic scoring spine
(I1 → I4/I5 → I6) is complete. Per-packet detail in `INGESTION-PLAN.md`; landings in
`BUILDLOG.md` (2026-06-10 session 2). Contracts in `docs/schemas/REGISTRY.md`.

- **I1** `lgwks_vector.py` — `lgwks.vector.record.v1` (binary f32, blake2b cid, space guard).
- **I2** `lgwks_input.py` — `lgwks.modality.item.v1` (universal input routing).
- **I3** `crawler/` v2 + `lgwks_lfm2_extract.py` — `lgwks.crawl.v2` + `…artifacts.v1` (PR #64).
- **I4** `lgwks_embed_port.py` — `lgwks.embed.port.v1` (mlx→transformers, local-only).
- **I5** `lgwks_score.py` — `lgwks.score.record.v1` + `lgwks.schema.relations.v1`: factored
  RESCAL `R_k`, CBOR+zstd MDL, blake2b cid (PR #65). CLI `lgwks score`.
- **I6** `lgwks_rank.py` — `lgwks.rank.record.v1`: relation-weighted vs relation-blind
  centrality, σ-shifted power iteration + Rayleigh convergence, δ slop signal (PR #67).
  CLI `lgwks rank`. Closes G-06.
- **I7** `lgwks_inbound.py` — `lgwks.inbound.v1`: RRF fusion of graph rank ⊕ vector cosine
  rank (`RRF_K=60`), 1500-token reflex cap, deterministic truncation (bulk first, depth
  pointers survive), zero-dangling handles. CLI `lgwks inbound run|info`. 14 tests incl
  real-graph. Hook extension still gated on the re-registration ops action (below).
- **I5.1** `lgwks_score.py` — directional operators activated: `R_k = P_k·diag(d_k) + N_k`,
  antisymmetric `N_k` paired so `Σ_k N_k = 0` ⇒ marginal stays identity (§4.2 proof exact)
  while directed relations score asymmetrically. Schema relations v1→v2 (issue #69). 28 tests.
  **Structural** directionality only — semantic arg-typing remains future work (`arg_typing=None`).
- **I12** graphify Leiden fix (PR #63).

Gaps G-04/05/06/11/12 closed (INGESTION-LAYER §8).

## NOT built / deferred (honest — do not claim otherwise)

- **§4.3 honesty** — with fixed `w_k`, I6 centrality is a relation-WEIGHTED eigenvector
  centrality (faithful to §4.3 for the n×m×n tensor), not a free cubic-in-x optimization.
  δ is a structural signal until I5.1 wires per-fact `s_ai`.
- **I8 P3→P0 trigger** — admission/capability boilerplate is complete and tested. P3→P0
  escalation trigger is documented in CLI output but NOT wired to a live process manager.
  Must escalate before any multi-tenant or network exposure.
- **I10 viz embedding join** — `to_frontend` wires `xyz_map` placeholder; a real SQLite join
  (embeddings-by-cid from the vector store) is needed to populate server-side coordinates
  at serve time. Not in I10 scope (viz-only); wire when the vector store is queryable at
  graph-serve time.
- **I11 citation detection** — cid substring-match proxy; true semantic citation detection
  would need model-layer analysis (out of scope, INV-3). Deterministic and explainable.
- **Hook re-registration** — `hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` still points at the dead
  space-named `/Applications/Logical Works` path. Gated on ops action (below).

## Workflow that worked this session (the Director's loop)

Per substantive packet: **spec (GH issue comment) → implement → hacker-harden → merge.**
Implementation can be delegated to a Sonnet subagent (the issue spec is the contract);
**review/harden in the main thread** — green subagent tests repeatedly hid real defects
(hollow signals, silent non-convergence, dead/unwired CLI). Recurring integration traps:
(1) every new `lgwks.*.vN` literal needs a `REGISTRY.md` row or the `governance.yml` CI
gate fails; (2) a new CLI verb must be wired in the `lgwks` dispatcher AND added to
`lgwks_home._DOMAINS` (the `test_home` L0 no-Other-catch-all invariant); (3) run the
registry gate from the repo root, not a `.claude/` worktree (it skips `.claude` paths).

## Current state (updated — session 4, 2026-06-11)

Ingestion packets **I1–I12 are all scaffolded**. I1–I7 + I5.1 + I12 are merged to main.
I8–I11 boilerplate was implemented in session 4 (branch `claude/docs-implementation-boilerplate-83n6r1`):
- **I8** `lgwks_admission.py` + `lgwks_capability.py` — token-bucket admission + capability-token isolation.
- **I9** `lgwks_crdt.py` — G-Set / OR-Set / LWW-Register, SEC convergence proof in tests.
- **I10** `lgwks_viz_project.py` — sign-fixed PCA projection, additive `xyz` in `to_frontend`.
- **I11** `lgwks_waste.py` — per-session waste ledger; `lgwks.waste.ledger.v1` flipped live.
All 61 new tests green. Registry gate green (95 ids / 103 rows).

## Current state (updated — session 6, 2026-06-11, post PR #76)

**I8–I11 boilerplate is merged to main** (PR #76 @ 6c2fdac — admission, capability, CRDT, viz-projection,
waste ledger; adversarially reviewed). **GH issues #72–#75 are filed and OPEN** (I8/I9/I10/I11, label
`ingestion`). The modules + tests are landed; what remains per issue is the **hardening/deployment** half of
each `Done =` line — the boilerplate is the structure, not the close. The I-series plan (I1–I12) is the
*entire* active backlog; PLANS-NEXT-4 closes with "after I11 the ingestion plan is fully landed" — there is
no I13.

## Suggested next step

**Close the open I-series tail, I8 first — reframed (session 6) as multi-tenant concurrency + isolation over
the two-DB topology.** Director clarified the real surface: concurrency is within one tenant *and* across
tenants; the complexity is the **shared world DB ("the Google", `store/substrate-global/`) + the private
per-pair DB (`store/projects/`)**; the §1-INV tenant isolation holding **under concurrent load** is the
security load (Figma / Google Workspace daemon model). Gap analysis: **[ARCH-two-db-multitenant.md](ARCH-two-db-multitenant.md)**
(L1–L9). I8 packet: **[PLANS-NEXT-5.md](PLANS-NEXT-5.md)**. Deferred surfaces (network/MCP, sharing/ACL):
**[SCOPE-DEFERRED.md](SCOPE-DEFERRED.md)**.

**Hardest surface = §1-INV under concurrency** (ARCH L1+L2+L7 enforced through L3+L4). Build order inside I8:
1. **Enforce §1-INV (L1/L2):** tier-routing access layer + tenant-scoped private reads
   (`get_record_for_tenant`/`query_by_source_for_tenant`, capability-guarded). Today `lgwks_vector` reads
   never filter on `tenant` → A can read B. The load-bearing fix.
2. **Tier-scoped capability (L7):** token scopes `tenant:rw` / `world:r` / `world:promote`, not a flat tenant.
3. **Per-tenant durable no-drop fair queue (L3/L4):** durable cross-process `admission_queue` table over
   `lgwks_sqlite.connect` (WAL); backpressure not 429; per-tenant buckets ordered AFTER cap (fixes the
   fail-OPEN, RECONCILE.md:318); fair leasing ≤ `c`; lease/reap crash-durability.
4. **Promotion audit (L5):** tenant→world is the only cross-tier write, logged to the cognition chain.

After I8: **#73 (I9 — deploy CRDT on both tiers, ARCH L6:** G-Set world / OR-Set+LWW tenant, wired to the
live stores) → **#74 (I10** vector-store join) → **#75 (I11** daemon wiring; confirm `LGWKS_TRANSCRIPT_PATH`
with the Director). After #75 the ingestion plan is fully landed.

### Simplest-now correction (session 6 final — read this before the two-DB spec above)
The Director scoped I8 down: **"it's all 1 conceptual db; world data shared; standard data called in at
query; log the complexity as future, get the thing working basically."** So the **now-build** is minimal —
one logical store (`vector_records`), a `tenant` column with a `'world'` sentinel for shared rows, a tenant
read = `WHERE tenant = ? OR tenant = 'world'`, and WAL (`lgwks_sqlite.connect`) for basic concurrency. See
[PLANS-NEXT-5.md](PLANS-NEXT-5.md). The full capability-crypto / durable-queue / CRDT / promotion hardening
([ARCH-two-db-multitenant.md](ARCH-two-db-multitenant.md), [SCOPE-DEFERRED.md](SCOPE-DEFERRED.md)) is the
*destination*, not the next commit. North star (framing only, do not over-build): an AI-first Unix-style CLI,
"the daemon you code on" — keep modules small/composable.

### Boilerplate home/stale audit (session 6 — what to wire vs what is staling)
PR #76 added 5 modules. All are CLI-wired in the `lgwks` dispatcher (`lgwks:1483-1500`) but most have **no
runtime caller** — they are scaffolding that will stale unless the canonical issue that owns each is worked.
None is dead/removable; each has a designated home in an open issue:

| module | runtime caller? | home (open issue) | status |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| `lgwks_viz_project.py` | yes — `lgwks_graph_viz.py` | #74 (I10 vector-store join completes the feed) | **partial home**; needs the cid→embedding join |
| `lgwks_capability.py` | `lgwks_vector.query_for_tenant()` | #72 closed | **homed** — tenant field feeds WHERE clause |
| `lgwks_admission.py` | none | deferred — parked for durable-queue future | scaffolding; staling; SCOPE-DEFERRED.md |
| `lgwks_crdt.py` | `lgwks_pipeline.run_pipeline()` Stage 1.5 | #73 closed | **homed** — GSet/ORSet live node tracker |
| `lgwks_waste.py` | `lgwks_session.session_end()` + pipeline Stage 12 | #75 closed | **homed** — wired via LGWKS_TRANSCRIPT_PATH |

**I-series status (session 7):** I1–I12 all landed. No open ingestion issues. `lgwks_admission.py` is the one remaining staling module — its home is the durable-queue / P3→P0 future work documented in ARCH-two-db-multitenant.md.

**Open ops action (carried from I7):** re-register `hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` against the live
`/Applications/logicalworks` dir (currently points at dead space-named path). Confirm path first.

**Open ops action (carried from I7):** to wire the L5 reflex pack into the live
`UserPromptSubmit` hook, re-register `hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` against the live
`/Applications/logicalworks` dir (it points at the dead space-named `/Applications/Logical
Works`). Confirm the path with the Director before relying on live hook behavior. The I7
module + CLI + tests do not depend on it.

## Session 7 state (2026-06-11, PR #79 → main @ 7e570b5)

**I-series: fully landed.** Issues #72–#75 closed. I1–I12 all done.

| module | status | home |
|---|---|---|
| `lgwks_vector` | ✅ homed | I1 + I8 (query_for_tenant) |
| `lgwks_crdt` | ✅ homed | I9 — pipeline Stage 1.5 |
| `lgwks_viz_project` | ✅ homed (partial) | I10 — graph_viz.to_frontend; vector-store join deferred |
| `lgwks_waste` | ✅ homed | I11 — session_end + pipeline Stage 12 |
| `lgwks_admission` | staling | parked for durable-queue future (SCOPE-DEFERRED.md) |
| `lgwks_capability` | ✅ homed | I8 — tenant field → query_for_tenant WHERE clause |

**Next:** no open ingestion issues. Remaining deferred surfaces: crypto §1-INV enforcement, per-tenant durable queue, promotion audit, network/MCP (all in ARCH-two-db-multitenant.md + SCOPE-DEFERRED.md). The P3→P0 trigger for `lgwks_admission` fires before any multi-tenant or network exposure. The hook re-registration ops action (subconscious_inbound.py → live `/Applications/logicalworks` path) is still pending — confirm path with Director before relying on live hook behavior.

## Session 8 state (2026-06-11, main @ 8353036)

**PRD §13 first slice: 2/3 done.**

| unit | status | module | commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| U1 Capability Map | ✅ CLI wired + all verbs covered | `lgwks_map.py` — `add_parser` + 64 intent strings filled | 0b8665d |
| U6 Subconscious Engine | ✅ standalone green | `lgwks_engine.py` — `lgwks.engine.schema.v1` | 8353036 |
| U7 Inbound hook | **next** | upgrade `hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` to call `run_engine()` | — |

**What U7-minimal requires (do not hook until Director confirms):**
1. Replace the `lgwks_map.map_intent()` call in `hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` with `lgwks_engine.run_engine(prompt)`.
2. Format `additionalContext` from the full §6 schema (C/G/P + selections + flags), not just the verb list.
3. Confirm the hook path is registered against the live `/Applications/logicalworks` dir (not the dead `/Applications/Logical Works` path).
4. Test standalone: pipe a JSON prompt payload to `python3 hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` and verify `additionalContext` contains the §6 schema.
5. Only then re-register with `lgwks hooks install`.

**Codebase shape (session 8):**
- 125 modules, 45,246 LOC, 0 staling (NAVMAP regenerated)
- archive/: 8 modules parked (lgwks_actor, lgwks_algorithms, lgwks_diff, lgwks_had, lgwks_local_llm, lgwks_math, lgwks_monitor, lgwks_sast)
- 63 CLI verbs, all mapped to a home domain (no-Other invariant holds)
- Governance gate: 97/97 schema IDs registered

**open ops action (carried from I7):** re-register `hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` against the live `/Applications/logicalworks` dir — confirm path with Director before wiring U7.

**Parallel tracks (do not block U7):** U2 (Actor contract), U3 (World-Graph query), U4 (BERT runtime), U5 (Transcript Cortex) all run in parallel per PRD §12 and upgrade U6 once landed. PRD §13 says: U1 + U7-minimal first (deterministic signals), BERT upgrades the `attention` field after.

## Session 9 state (2026-06-12, main @ dd30d10)

**PRD §13 first slice: DONE. U1 ✅ U6 ✅ U7 ✅.** Then the two U6.1 follow-ons landed.

| unit | status | module | commit / PR |
|---|---|---|---|
| U7 Inbound hook | ✅ closed (#81) — `run_engine()` wired, §6 schema injected; verified test-only | `hooks/subconscious_inbound.py` | #82 |
| U6.2 Qwen-cosine seam | ✅ merged (#85) — coverage→cosine, availability-gated over lexical floor | `lgwks_engine.py` + `scripts/build_capability_embeddings.py` | #87 |
| U6.3 / invariant I8 | ✅ merged (#86) — demand-weighted coverage, padding/verbosity-invariant | `lgwks_engine.py` + `scripts/build_capability_idf.py` | #87 |

**§6 score axes now (post U6.1/U6.2/U6.3):** C coverage (lexical+demand OR Qwen-cosine; `coverage_mode` reports which) · G grounding gap (graph, nullable) · d decisiveness (margin) · P = geometric mean over available axes (constant-free). New artifacts: `lgwks.capability_idf.v1`, `lgwks.capability_vectors.v1` (both optional, runtime degrades gracefully when absent).

**Hardened (adversarial pass):** `.lgwks/*.json` artifacts are an untrusted input surface — sanitized (finite/non-negative weights), C clamped to [0,1], `_embedding_coverage` fully guarded (poison → lexical floor, never raises), prompt capped (`_MAX_PROMPT_CHARS`). 52 engine/invariant/hook tests green.

**Codebase shape (session 9):** 128 modules, 46,444 LOC (NAVMAP regenerated). Governance gate: 99/99 schema IDs registered.

**Two open ops/decisions (Director-gated):**
1. **Live hook wiring** — U7 is verified test-only; the `UserPromptSubmit` hook is NOT registered. Wire it into `/Applications/logicalworks/.claude/settings.json` when the Director wants live interception (it's a `UserPromptSubmit` Claude-Code hook, NOT an `lgwks hooks` bus event).
2. **Activate qwen mode** — `make download-models` (Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B not present here) + run the two `scripts/build_capability_*` builders; the engine stays on the lexical floor until then.

## Session 13 state (2026-06-12)

This pass closed the three CIAM micro-debts filed out of #97:

- **#104 inbound → capability handle:** tenant-scoped inbound reads now resolve a capability
  at the CLI boundary and route through `lgwks_access.TenantStore.read(...)` inside
  `assemble_inbound(...)`; the unscoped single-operator path remains the explicit
  `ADMIN`-sentinel fail-open.
- **#105 reconverge file-lock:** `lgwks_crdt.JsonFileSink` now exposes an explicit `locked()`
  seam and `reconverge(...)` holds that lock across load → merge → commit. This follows the
  repo’s existing “guard at the storage seam” pattern rather than smuggling file concerns into
  callers.
- **#106 entity-graph OR-Set wiring:** `lgwks_entity_graph.GraphDB` now tracks mutable node
  and edge membership in a `*.crdt.json` sidecar via `ORSet` add/remove through
  `lgwks_crdt.reconverge(...)`. Query surfaces filter by visible CRDT membership once the
  sidecar exists. Mutator entry validation was tightened in the same pass.

Verification receipts:
- `pytest -q tests/test_inbound.py` → `16 passed`
- `pytest -q tests/test_crdt.py tests/test_entity_graph.py` → `32 passed`

**Next deferred (need Director go):** N novelty axis + `attention` (Qwen-native); P→probability calibration (outcome log + isotonic fit). U2–U5 parallel tracks still upgrade U6 once landed.

## Session 10 state (2026-06-12, main @ 8586b11, PR #90)

**I8-hardening track opened (#89) — L1 landed.** The deferred half of I8 (the full multi-tenant
destination in `ARCH-two-db-multitenant.md`, gaps L1–L7) was promoted out of the SCOPE-DEFERRED
ledger into issue **#89**. Director scoped the full packet (L1–L5); built the load-bearing first
step this session.

**L1+L2+L7 done (PR #90 @ 8586b11) — §1-INV now cryptographically enforced:**

| piece | what | module |
|---|---|---|
| L7 tier-scoped caps | `lgwks.capability.v1→v2`: scopes (`tenant:rw`/`world:r`/`world:promote`) signed into the HMAC payload → escalation/narrowing breaks the sig. `require_scope()` gates each tier op. | `lgwks_capability.py` |
| L1 secure cid read | `get_record_for_tenant()` — resolves own ⊕ world only; cross-tenant cid → `None` (no existence side-channel). `get_record`/`query_by_source` marked UNSCOPED/admin-only. | `lgwks_vector.py` |
| L2 seam on read path | `assemble_inbound(tenant=...)` + `inbound run --tenant` — cross-tenant graph nodes drop from the reflex pack. | `lgwks_inbound.py` |
| harden (in-thread) | `world` reserved as non-issuable + guard-rejected; `make_tenant_filter` world-aware. | `lgwks_capability.py` |

81 tests green (incl. §1-INV **10⁴ A/B against a live on-disk store**); registry 99/99 (v2 row,
v1 superseded). BUILDLOG + NAVMAP updated in-PR.

**Honest limits (NOT closed — deferred to the L2/L3 access router; documented in BUILDLOG):**
1. **Enforcement is advisory** — `query_for_tenant`/`get_record_for_tenant` trust the tenant
   string; nothing structurally forces every caller through `guard`/`require_scope`. Mandatory
   gating is the L2 access-router work.
2. **`assemble_inbound(tenant=None)` is fail-open** by design (single-operator P3 default) until
   multi-tenant exposure.

**L3 done (PR #92 @ caab5f2) — per-tenant admission, fail-open closed:**

| piece | what | module |
|---|---|---|
| capability-first | `TenantAdmissionGate.admit/lease/release` run `require_scope(TENANT_RW)` BEFORE any rate/queue/lease state → invalid/missing cap consumes no token, no slot. Closes the L1-noted "advisory enforcement" gap on the admission path. | `lgwks_admission.py` |
| per-tenant lanes | each validated tenant gets its own `TokenBucket` + bounded `AdmissionQueue` (per-tenant `q_max`) → one tenant's flood drains only its own lane. | `lgwks_admission.py` |
| fair leasing ≤ c | in-flight bounded by `c` AND per-tenant ceiling ⌈c/active⌉ via `lease()/release()`. | `lgwks_admission.py` |

Reused `lgwks.admission.v1` (no mint). 73 tests green (12 new in `test_i8_admission_fairness.py`);
registry 99/99. **Honest limit:** in-memory single-process; durable cross-process backing is L4
(the `lease()/release()` interface is left for L4 to persist).

**L4 done (PR #94 @ 3dbe01f) — durable cross-process queue:**

| piece | what | module |
|---|---|---|
| durable queue | `admission_queue` WAL table over `lgwks_sqlite.connect`; PK `(tenant,cid)` idempotent; state `queued→leased→done`; rows survive process restart. Mints `lgwks.admission_queue.v1`. | `lgwks_admission_store.py` (new) |
| cross-process fairness | enqueue/lease in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (atomic across processes); fair leasing ≤ c from the DB COUNT → holds across processes (refines L3 in-memory limit). | `lgwks_admission_store.py` |
| crash-durable lease/reap | `reap()` reclaims past-deadline leases → `queued`, `retry_count++`; a crashed worker's work is never lost. backpressure not drop. | `lgwks_admission_store.py` |
| wiring | `TenantAdmissionGate(store_path=...)` opt-in delegates the queue to the durable store (`gate.store` = daemon handle); `store_path=None` keeps the L3 in-memory P3 default. | `lgwks_admission.py` |

85 tests green (14 new in `test_i8_durable_queue.py`); registry **100/100**. `item` is an opaque
JSON handle, never raw content (§1-INV). **Honest limits:** `done` rows retained (prune = future
ops); `reap` is an unauthenticated daemon maintenance op (lease-state only, no content).

**Next (issue #89 tail — LAST step):** **L5** promotion audit — the tenant→world write is the only
cross-tier path; log who/what/when/under-which-cap as a **hash-chained record on the cognition
chain** (`lgwks_cognition.py`), gated by the `world:promote` scope (already minted in
`lgwks.capability.v2`). After L5, **#89 closes**. **L6** (CRDT deploy on the two stores) is a
separate packet = I9. Deferred surfaces (network/MCP D2, cross-workspace ACL D3, …) stay parked in
`SCOPE-DEFERRED.md`.

## Doc map

## Session 11 state (2026-06-12, branch claude/i8-l5-promotion-audit, PR pending)

**I8-hardening L5 DONE — #89 ready to close.** The tenant→world promotion path is now gated +
audited (ARCH L5 closed). All L-steps of #89 (L1+L2+L7, L3, L4, L5) have landed.

| piece | what | module |
|---|---|---|
| L5 store move | `promote_cid_to_world(conn,cid,tenant)` — `UPDATE tenant→'world'` owning-tenant-guarded; move-not-copy (tenant ∉ cid). No commit; caller commits after audit. | `lgwks_vector.py` |
| L5 orchestrator | `promote(conn,cid,token,key,…)` — `require_scope(WORLD_PROMOTE)` → ownership pre-check → stage move → append `"promotion"` audit → commit; audit-gates-commit, rollback on any failure. | `lgwks_promote.py` (new) |
| L5 audit kind | `_KINDS += "promotion"` — hash-chained provenance `{tenant,cid,source_cid,space_id,scope,nonce}`; no raw secret. No new schema minted (cognition chain is the contract). | `lgwks_cognition.py` |

52 tests green (6 new `tests/test_i8_promotion_audit.py`); registry 100/100; NAVMAP regen → 130 modules,
`lgwks_promote` active.

**Honest limits (deferred — NOT regressions):**
1. **No live caller of `promote()` yet** — the operator/daemon CLI + capability-key lifecycle that
   would call it in production is the L2 access-router / daemon packet (capability D-note: "caller owns
   the secret lifecycle"). L5 ships the gated primitive + audit; wiring it live is the next packet.
2. **One orphan-audit window** — cognition + vector store share no transaction; audit-before-commit
   means a committed promotion always has a durable audit, but the rare reverse (audit appended, then
   `conn.commit()` fails) leaves an orphan audit (world row rolled back). Safe direction, surfaced by raise.

**Next:** close #89. Then the canonical deferred tail: **L6/I9** (CRDT deploy on world + tenant stores)
→ **L2 access-router** (mandatory gating so every store op routes through `require_scope`, + the live
promote surface). Network/MCP (D2), cross-workspace ACL (D3) stay parked in SCOPE-DEFERRED.md.

## Session 12 state (2026-06-12, main @ e4a03e2) — CIAM convergence epic #97 CLOSED

#89 closed. The **CIAM convergence epic #97** shipped end-to-end (build order B→A→C). The three
kernel-shaped seams now exist, each with ONE local impl, kernel swap-in additive (no rewrite):

| sub | what landed | seam (final interface, local impl) | PR |
|---|---|---|---|
| #98 B | capability lifecycle + operator `lgwks access promote`/`resolve`; per-principal key persisted to Keychain (`lgwks:cap:<principal>`) | `lgwks_access.CapabilityPort` ← `HmacCapabilityPort` | #101 |
| #99 A | `ADMIN` sentinel + `AdminOnlyError` guard the 3 UNSCOPED vector primitives; `TenantStore` is the single sanctioned tenant door — §1-INV is now MECHANICAL | `lgwks_access.TenantStore` (kernel `Port::invoke` analogue) | #102 |
| #100 C | `reconverge(sink, current)` = load prior replica → per-key CvRDT merge → commit; pipeline reconverges into stable `PIPELINE_STORE/crdt_replica.json` | `lgwks_crdt.ConvergenceSink` ← `JsonFileSink` | #103 |

Hardening receipts: #101 shipped with 4 real defects the green suite hid (broken Keychain
persistence — read via keyvault registry, write direct; dead promote CLI; `sys` NameError) —
all fixed pre-merge. #99/#100 each caught a real bug in review (embed_port stub `ImportError`;
OR-Set byte-idempotency). Schema gate green throughout (no new payload schema). NAVMAP regen.

**Open micro-debts (filed, scoped):** #104 `lgwks_inbound.fuse` → take a `CapabilityPort` handle
not a raw tenant string (its read path is already §1-INV-scoped; this kills the raw-string trust).
#105 file-lock / daemon-own the `reconverge` replica commit (concurrent *processes* can lose a
merge — load→commit isn't locked). #106 route entity-graph mutable membership through OR-Set
beyond the pipeline's world_nodes/tenant_edges. All three are ADDITIVE behind existing seams.

**Known pre-existing (NOT a regression):** `tests/test_embed_port.py` stubs `lgwks_vector` only if
it imports first → 2 order-dependent `.meta` fails / collection error in shared-process runs (on
`main`; see `reference_lgwks_full_suite_collection_quirk`). CI runs only the schema gate (no pytest).

### HARDENED next-surface plan — D2: network/MCP/HTTP transport (NOT filed; needs Director trigger "expose beyond localhost")

The whole I8/I9 sequence existed to make the local core concurrency- and isolation-safe FIRST so the
remote surface is a **thin adapter over an already-safe core** (ARCH §"hardest surface"). That core is
now safe. Build D2 so it ADDS a transport, never refactors the core:

- **The seam is already the core's public API — do not invent a parallel one.** A request handler maps:
  inbound credential → `CapabilityPort.resolve(principal)` → opaque handle; one request verb → exactly
  one `TenantStore` method (`read`/`query`/`write`/`promote`); apply the admission queue (#89 L3/L4) at
  the edge for backpressure + the **D1 429/Retry-After** contract. The `ADMIN` guard already makes it
  impossible for a handler to touch `vector_records` directly — lean on that, don't re-check.
- **Build NOW (even before D2) the object both the CLI and the future handler construct:** a
  `Session`/`RequestContext` that pairs `{resolved CapabilityPort handle, TenantStore, admission lease}`.
  `lgwks_session.py` is the natural home (it already does begin/end/capability). If the local CLI paths
  route through that one object today, D2 becomes "an HTTP/MCP handler that builds a Session from a
  request" — additive — instead of threading auth+store+admission through new call sites (a refactor).
- **Keep transport opaque to the engine:** the adapter imports the core; the core never imports
  transport. Token stays opaque (no handler reads `.sig/.scopes`). This preserves the #97 standalone
  invariant and the future kernel `KernelBridge`/HTTP-syscall swap (see `project_lgwks_kernel_ciam_convergence`).
- **Out of scope for D2, file separately when triggered:** cross-machine CRDT sync transport (D4),
  cross-workspace ACL (D3), promotion-review UI (D5), per-tenant billing (D6) — all in SCOPE-DEFERRED.md,
  dependencies now satisfied.

## Session 14 state — 2026-06-12 · main @ 418e888 · 74 tests green

This session closed the **daemon core work package** (DAEMON-CORE-PLAN.md §5 Moves 1–8):

| Move | What | Commit |
|------|------|--------|
| 1–5 | Event model, lifecycle, work queue, research front door, Claude adapter | prior sessions |
| 6 | Codex + Gemini ingress adapters (`hooks/codex_inbound.py`, `hooks/gemini_inbound.py`) | `2e8e638` |
| 7 = P2 | `WorktreeManager`: git worktree create/close/list, per-session referee (no duplicate), CRDT ORSet audit trail, migration v4, `worktree_open`/`worktree_close` WORK_KINDS | `12383d2` |
| 8 = P5 | `ExportManager`: `export_run` (tar.gz + sha256), `verify_export`, `cleanup_run` (blocked without verified export), `export_session` (JSONL), migration v5 | `a816b4d` |

Git alignment: 12 merged local branches deleted, 2 stale worktrees pruned. 4 surviving remote
feature branches (epic-97, issue-99, issue-100, docs-handoff-refresh-session-12) predate daemon
work and are preserved for context; they are diverged from current main.

**P0 acceptance** (all met):
- daemon starts independently ✅
- restart loses no committed state ✅
- ingress can enqueue work ✅
- packet fetched deterministically ✅
- three concurrent agents don't corrupt state ✅ (BEGIN IMMEDIATE + per-session referee)

### Open seams (next agent's entry points)

**D2 network/MCP transport** (unchanged from session-13 plan — the seam is the public API):
- inbound credential → `CapabilityPort.resolve` → `TenantStore` → `admission_queue`
- build `Session`/`RequestContext` in `lgwks_session.py` first so D2 is additive

**Worktree merge arbitration** (next natural P2 extension):
- `WorktreeManager.close()` triggers `lgwks_crdt.reconverge()` for overlapping file changes
- seam is ready: `JsonFileSink.locked()` + existing `ORSet` sidecar pattern from #106

**Cloud export tier** (P5 extension, not filed):
- extend `ExportManager.export_run()` with a backend parameter (S3/GCS)
- `lgwks.daemon.export.v0` schema is already the right envelope; no schema bump needed

**P1 transcript normalization** (not filed):
- Codex/Gemini adapters emit `human_message` only; tool calls / transcript turns from those clients
  still need wiring into the normalized event stream
- seam: `lgwks_daemon_event.KINDS` already has `transcript_turn` / `tool_call` / `file_change`

**Known pre-existing (NOT regressions):**
- `test_home.py::test_domain_for_coverage` and `test_browser_navigates_domain_to_command` — pre-existing failures on main before this session (verified with `git stash`)
- `lgwks_vector` import-order collection quirk — pre-existing; run per-area or `make test-python`

If the Director triggers D2, file it as the next issue and spec against the Session seam above first.

## Session 15 state — 2026-06-12 · main @ `6182a7d` (PR #112 + #113 merged)

Also merged in this session: **PR #112** (Gemini code review graph — `.code-review-graph/`, `.mcp.json`, `scripts/generate-graph.sh`, `CLAUDE.md` doc). Not in the ingestion plan; static analysis layer.

Three canonical issues filed and implemented (PR #113). All 22 new tests pass; 114 existing unaffected.

| issue | what | status |
|---|---|---|
| #109 P1 transcript normalization | `lgwks_transcript.py` tail-reader + `hooks/claude_tool_hook.py` (PostToolUse → `tool_call`) + `hooks/claude_stop_hook.py` (Stop → `transcript_turn`) | ✅ merged `6182a7d` |
| #110 D2-prep RequestContext | `lgwks_session.RequestContext` frozen dataclass + `make_context()` factory | ✅ merged `6182a7d` |
| #111 P2 worktree CRDT merge | `WorktreeManager._crdt_reconverge_entity_graph()` called BEFORE git remove; FAIL-SILENT | ✅ merged `6182a7d` |

NAVMAP regenerated: **140 modules, 50,602 LOC**.

**Honest limits / next ops actions:**
1. **Live hook wiring** — `claude_tool_hook.py` and `claude_stop_hook.py` are shipped but NOT registered in `.claude/settings.local.json`. Add `PostToolUse` + `Stop` hook entries when Director wants live telemetry.
2. **D2 trigger pending** — `RequestContext` seam is built; D2 (network/MCP transport) needs Director "expose beyond localhost" trigger before filing.
3. **P1 Codex/Gemini tool-call normalization** — only Claude Code supports PostToolUse hooks; Codex/Gemini still `human_message` only for now.

**Next canonical seams (no Director trigger needed):**
- ~~Wire `assemble_inbound()` and `promote()` to accept a `RequestContext`~~ ✅ Done session 16.

**Next canonical seams (Director trigger required):**
- D2 network/MCP transport: file issue once Director triggers "expose beyond localhost".
- Live hook registration (PostToolUse + Stop): Director confirms when to wire.
- N novelty axis + calibrated P probability (U6.4) — Director go needed.

## Session 17 state — 2026-06-12 · main @ `6ba90b3`

**P3 research front door query surface — complete**

| change | what | impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| `DaemonEventStore.get_run(run_id)` | reads `manifest_json` from `daemon_runs`, returns full manifest dict or `None` | exposes artifact paths (graph.json, substrate.db, etc.) to callers |
| `daemon runs list` | renamed from leaf `runs`; identical behavior | backward-compat path via new subparser |
| `daemon runs get <run_id>` | new — streams full manifest JSON; exits 1 on unknown | closes P3: a prior indexed run's packet is now retrievable on demand |

14 tests in `test_daemon_e2e.py` — all pass. 162 total pass / 1 pre-existing failure.

**End-to-end research pipeline now fully queryable without hooks:**
```
lgwks daemon research <url>      # index a run
lgwks daemon runs list           # list indexed runs → get run_id
lgwks daemon runs get <run_id>   # retrieve full manifest → artifact paths
lgwks daemon emit --kind human_message --session-id s1 --agent-id claude
lgwks daemon packet get --session-id s1 --agent-id claude
```

**Honest limits:**
1. **No inbound packet from a run's vector store** — `runs get` returns the manifest (artifact paths); calling `lgwks inbound run <graph.json> --store <substrate.db>` is still a separate step. A `daemon runs packet <run_id>` convenience that assembles the RRF pack directly is a possible next seam but needs Director go (adds a non-trivial path through assemble_inbound).
2. **Hooks still deferred** — PostToolUse + Stop hooks NOT in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

**Next canonical seams (no Director trigger):**
- `daemon runs packet <run_id>` convenience — assembles inbound RRF pack from a prior run's substrate.db + graph.json on demand (needs Director go; touches assemble_inbound).
- None currently filed; board is clean.

**Next canonical seams (Director trigger required):**
- D2 network/MCP transport: file once Director triggers "expose beyond localhost".
- Live hook registration: PostToolUse + Stop when Director confirms.
- N novelty axis + calibrated P probability (U6.4) — Director go needed.

## Session 16 state — 2026-06-12 · main @ `a0bb658`

**RequestContext wiring + daemon emit command (no Director trigger required)**

| change | what | impact |
|---|---|---|
| `assemble_inbound(ctx=)` | `ctx: Optional[Any]` kwarg; when set, `tenant_store = ctx.store`; `store_conn=None` accepted | kills raw-string trust at the inbound call site |
| inbound CLI `_cmd_run` | uses `make_context()` instead of threading `(port, handle, key)` manually | first CLI path through RequestContext |
| `lgwks daemon emit` | new subcommand; injects any event kind into the daemon store without hooks | **end-to-end testable without live hook wiring** |
| `_DOMAINS` fix | `daemon` + `access` added to `System` domain | closes pre-existing `test_domain_for_coverage` failure |

10 new tests in `tests/test_daemon_e2e.py` — all pass. 114 existing unaffected.

**End-to-end pipeline now testable without hooks:**
```
lgwks daemon start
lgwks daemon emit --kind human_message --session-id s1 --agent-id claude
lgwks daemon packet get --session-id s1 --agent-id claude
lgwks daemon stop
```

**Honest limits:**
1. **Hooks still deferred** — Director go required before registering PostToolUse + Stop in `.claude/settings.local.json`.
2. **`promote()` raw-string path** — `_access_promote_command` already routes through `TenantStore.promote(cid)`; the `lgwks_promote.promote()` function itself takes `(conn, cid, token, key)` — this is the internal primitive, not a caller-facing API. No change needed there.

**Next canonical seams (no Director trigger):**
- P3 research front door query surface — `daemon research <url>` indexes runs; missing: one query surface to retrieve a prior run's packet on demand.
- N novelty axis + calibrated P (U6.4) — Director go needed.

**Next canonical seams (Director trigger required):**
- D2 network/MCP transport: file once Director triggers "expose beyond localhost".
- Live hook registration: PostToolUse + Stop when Director confirms.
